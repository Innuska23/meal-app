### Use the following technologies:

- [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php?ref=apilist.fun) as `API`.
- `React`.
- `TypeScript`.
- other auxiliary libraries.

### There should be three pages:

1. All recipes page (display a photo, name, category, and place of origin in the form of a card).
2. Single recipe page (display all the data we receive).
3. Favorite recipes page (something like a shopping cart - display cards of favorite recipes, a summary list of their ingredients, and cooking instructions).
